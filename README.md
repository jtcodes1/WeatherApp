# Weather Forecast Dashboard

**Author:** Jos Thomas  
**Project Type:** Personal Front-End Practice Project  
**Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js (CDN), Open-Meteo API, Browser Geolocation API

## Project Overview
This project is a fully front-end weather forecasting dashboard that allows users to search for any city and view real-time weather conditions, a 24-hour temperature forecast, and multi-day temperature trends. Users can also enable location access to retrieve local weather data instantly and toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
I built this application to strengthen my skills in working with external APIs, handling real user input, visualizing dynamic data with charts, and organizing a complete front-end project using only vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The entire app runs fully in the browser and requires no backend setup or API keys.

## What I Learned From This Project

Through this project, I learned how to:
- Work with real API data and handle asynchronous requests
- Convert and format real-world data for users
- Build interactive charts using JavaScript
- Manage basic application state like unit toggling and last search
- Debug real layout and rendering issues
- Design and organize a clean, dark-themed interface

## Future Improvements

Some improvements I would like to add in the future include:
- Saving favorite cities using localStorage  
- Automatically loading the last searched city  
- Adding precipitation and humidity charts  
- Adding better accessibility support
